# Change: Update awesome list structure and conventions

## Why
The current list is strong on web archiving but thin on broader digital
preservation topics, and the navigation/formatting is inconsistent. A more
structured layout and standardized entry format will make the list easier to
scan and more useful to a wider audience.

## What Changes
- Reorganize `README.md` into clearer sections and sub-sections, including new
  categories from the reformatting plan.
- Expand the Table of Contents to include sub-sections and new top-level areas.
- Add brief scope/introduction text for major sections.
- Add "How to Use This List" and "How to Contribute" sections.
- Standardize entry formatting and normalize bullet styles/descriptions.
- Optionally add small quality-of-life enhancements (e.g., last-updated line or
  tags) if they fit cleanly.

## Impact
- Affected specs: none
- Affected code: `README.md` (primary list content)
